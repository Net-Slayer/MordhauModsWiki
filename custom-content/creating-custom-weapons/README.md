# Creating Custom Weapons

Step 1.) Follow this video tutorial made by Fox on rigging your custom weapon\
[Custom Weapon Mods (Mordhau SDK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYQ9C0EwayM)

Step 2.) Edit the values in the class defaults as needed to best match your custom weapon. You can see what many of the commonly used values do in the [weapon-variables.md](weapon-variables.md "mention") section. When finished, make sure to Compile.&#x20;

### How to Make Custom Variants of Existing Weapons

Step 1.) Locate the weapon you would like to use, and make a child of it. For this demo I am using BP\_Greatsword. You will need to drag this child into your mods content folder.
