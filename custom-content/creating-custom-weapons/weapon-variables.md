# Weapon Variables

Equipment Name = Name of your weapon

There are 4 attacks you need to worry about. If you search the name of the attack it will show all available variables for the attack motion.

<table><thead><tr><th width="285">Attack</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stab Attack</td><td>Normal-mode Stab</td></tr><tr><td>Second Stab Attack</td><td>Alt-mode Stab</td></tr><tr><td>Strike Attack</td><td>Normal-mode Strike</td></tr><tr><td>Second Strike Attack</td><td>Alt-mode Strike</td></tr><tr><td>Kick Attack</td><td>Normal-mode Kick Attack</td></tr><tr><td>Second Kick Attack</td><td>Alt-Mode Kick Attack</td></tr><tr><td>Brawl</td><td>Currently Unknown </td></tr></tbody></table>

Windup = The amount of time it takes to wind up your weapon before you can start doing damage. (Higher numbers will make this weapon very slow, If you want the weapon to be fast I would recommend around .3-.5 windup, for slower weapons anything higher than .5 but donâ€™t go higher than 1 unless you want&#x20;

Release = The amount of time the weapon can do damage. If you have a higher number it will do damage for a longer time. Faster weapons usually have .3-.45 release, with .5-.8 being slow release weapons. Typically .525 release works best for most weapons.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">**Note: If you make weapons with release/windup values over 0.7 you can expect them to be very difficult to play with, but also can be fun and different.**</mark>_

### **Damage = The amount of Damage it will do**

**See the below chart for info on any of the damage arrays that exist in the weapons.**

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Array ID</th><th>Armor Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>No Armor</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Light Armor</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Medium Armor</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Heavy Armor</td></tr></tbody></table>

Stone Damage = The amount of damage it does to stone destroyables (none currently exist in vanilla mordhau)

Chip Damage = This will define how much damage your weapon will still do if they block. If you set value at 1 it will do the Damage you have set regardless if they block or not. Higher Than 1 can make it do increased damage if they block.
