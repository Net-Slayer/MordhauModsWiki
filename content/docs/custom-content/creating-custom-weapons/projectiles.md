# Projectiles

If using a projectile weapon like a bow or a rock, you need to also make a projectile class. Some weapons will even have a fire projectile class as well (bows)

Step 1.) create a child of any projectile you would like to use or make a similar one of BP\_RecurveBowArrow for example. Drag this into your mods folder. _<mark style="color:red;">Note: If you are making horde mode you will want to use the \_Horde variant of the projectiles or else they will not work with skills.</mark>_

Step 2.) on your custom ranged weapon, open the class defaults and search "Projectile Class" and set your custom projectile. If it is a bow weapon, also search "Fire Projectile Class"

Step 3.) Open the Projectile and edit the class defaults as needed, See the [weapon-variables.md](weapon-variables.md "mention") section.
